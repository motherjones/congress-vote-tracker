# Parasites and their Niches in Tech
I’ve been hearing a bunch about volatiles and stables lately; about how we are all the same basically, just in different parts of a transition from volatile to stable in an ever waging war of versions 0.0...1.0...2.0... I don't just use the word war casually I hear it again and again.

* Each Company is in a war to win
* Every Sprint is a battle
* Ever Product Owner a general
* Very emergency won a war story 

We talk about getting to version "one zero" like its a death march; because it is.  Not all veterans come home patriotic (not all come home at all), and some of us want to end the war.  End the obsession on shipping products.  End the scramble for resource allocation. End the obsession with a culture of perks.  So that we can build something worthwhile for the betterment of everyone.

## Here we get to the toxin
Like most wars the enemy isn't always what the generals tell you; often it's the generals themselves.  Typically we are told this war is users, deadlines, other companies, and funding. By coaching programmers to be "volatile" and "stable," we create enemies out of what were once comrades and forget to realize that these same tactics strengthen the power divide between business owners and employees.

Ultimately the sharks and the parasites in our community are not as separate or safe from everyone else as they expect.  Startups, large round VC funded companies, fail more readily than small businesses oriented around software

Who gains from this? Money managers-team starters making large salaries, selling off IP and email passwords, requiring high success rates across large portfolios to shoot for larger profits leveraging statistics. When we get right down to it calling ex-hedge fund managers and their dogs war criminals is enticing but I'd rather talk about the software community as a whole as an environment and not a war zone. Environments don't just have creatures that live in symbiosis with each other though they also have maladaptive predators and parasites.  

### Dichotomies Matter
Its not a coincidence that we keep revisiting the same issues in the projects and companies we build.  When we couch people as "volatile" vs. "stable" we don't acknowledge the underlying power dynamics creating them-we simply seek to reproduce the same failing environments.  Ones where people with violent anti-social behavior are able to piss all over their own personal parts of the noosphere and professional baby sitters make their stakes taming these beasts.

* “Volatile” engineers often get thrown away or placed in positions of ill-advised power.
* “Stable” engineers often get ignored or promoted to dead-end middle management positions.
* Technologies follow predictable patterns-each empowers or replaces the ones that come before it. Most attempts to force innovation end in boom or bust cycles.

Shanley recently did a great [talk](https://medium.com/about-work/3ac19d4bd478) 
on Fairy Tales as a metaphor for discussing the deeper subtext of engineering cultures.  One of the key points to bring away from this is that the stories we tell ourselves matter. The story of the volatile developer burning bridges and the mid-night oil to just get it done is tired and harmful; think about the children. We don't build these dichotomies to accurately explain human behavior, we do it to normalize maladaptive behaviors which superficially seem structurally uneconomical. 

### Whats the symptoms?
Misnomering startup as *culture* is a painful use of language and has drastic implications. At a conference recently I was told a story about a successful startup and how they cleverly solved the unavoidable problems associated with development culture.

doesn’t sound like something we should celebrate to make investment vehicles.  Sleep is good for your brain and thinking just a few minutes ahead avoids many obstacles. Now for all of this what do we get?

* Worker burnout and probable failure
* Technically uninteresting (or hobbled) projects
* Failures to evolve/entire life cycles trashed
* Little competent oversight and abuse
* Focus on inevitability over viability
* Usury and rent seeking behaviour against user base

## What happens when you survive?
So your long hours have paid off, metrics have been met, and your investors are now happy. No real income yet *probably*, but buzz and users and early adopters. It's time for a vacation, right?  No. It's time for "what have you done for me latelies" to rain down and ignore technical debt.  Frustrated management organizes, more hackathons, coding sprints.  All in an attempt reinvigorate a fire that wasn't there.  We only hire new people to experiment with placing them either them under or beside the old members.

An engineer's first response is going to be promoting the old guard. We are classically bad at this-especially under stress and with high levels of "developer vs. manager" unrest.  We tend to promote our sharks when we expect to require innovation. We put people with anti-social behaviors at the head of projects.  We do this because we hate management and we severely want to get push-back on technical problems or just push deadlines off enough to catch some breath.

So we say behavior like this is  necessary to innovate-that these behaviors are not just correlated with genius but a part of or required for it. That this is how we do it and this is how its always been done.

## Doing things this ways sucks!
Not many people understand how seriously bad this sucks and how little actually gets done because of it.  But here's a big secret: most new technologies are simply rebuilds of software that have already been in open source for years.  We either organize our core products on content(*shrugs*) or around some special magic that makes a result really, really easy; but these products still rest on well understood foundations.  

So most companies don't focus on this, they focus on making something that is shippable-which really means "works for investors".   Building the image of a product or service is easy-I've seen people get by with a power point. Building the actual product is often an epic task of weighing solutions and picking new teams.  So when the time comes we add constraints to the product and people who remind us of ourselves.  We avoid achieving core goals while building new adapters and features focusing on expansion rather than accessibility/flexibility.

Teaching people to work in teams is something we ultimately have to start implementing at younger ages. Not just in sports teams or social groups, but in making making collective technical decisions together which requires setting aside egos on completely different levels.  Decision making is a collective process and as a culture we should get over it.  Software has multiple levels and most companies fail.  We have been told and told to celebrate failure because “it's part of startup culture”. This concept is bull shit. Since we can't change elementary education for our current generation we have to approach this as a eminent problem.  

## Kings can't live without Serfs
What scares people like Linus more than anything is that they don't serve a real purpose for us. For every king of every little kernel there's already someone with enough knowledge and intelligence to take over the project from them. Often even with the ability to communicate and organize on longer timescales.  We create cults of personality not because it's functional but in fact because of cultural assumptions around intelligence.

The real question should become "why do we choose this situation"  I don't think its because the rest of us(code monkeys, consultants, peons) are sheep or want to get jerked around by the forces of developer mythos.  One of the major survival techniques of a parasite is seduce its host into maladaptive behaviours.  Some parasites cause their hosts to jump into bodies of water or crawl up to large heights to continue its life cycle. Viruses like rabies cause the host to have delusional and violent behaviour to increase its spread from one victim to the next.  

Sometimes people/cultures become sick and don't even know it; this serves the purpose or even creates new niches for these finely adapted parasites.  But its also this fine grained adaptation that makes these same parasites vulnerable to environmental changes.  If we can bring about some environment level change these same parasites will either adapt or go extinct.  I suspect most will adapt.

### The Danger Zone
Biological and ecological metaphors aside we can talk about creating safe spaces, not just functional or profitable or professional(fuck this word) but spaces where it is not safe or empowering to abuse and manipulate those around you.  We don't just achieve this through quite thought though there are reigns of power to be taken.  Doxing and pack trolling are a thing that can be used to protect each other on social media but on listserves at conferences and in our own workplaces we need better tools.  Not all of these places can be fixed at immediately and having to learn to deal in those situation is a collective pain that dearly needs to be alleviated.  

Violence and "retraining" can come in many forms, however, including having Linus kickbanned from everything.  Its one thing to tell your boss that they are a giant piece of shit after they fire you without pay(or make you undo months/years of work) and another to call an uninformed person derogatory feminizing/racist terms or the "more pc" fall back [insert ablest bullshit here].  Is there any real harm in actually excluding people from channels/listserves/hacker spaces when they are actively impeding the health and development of our communities; even if their name is on the kernel.

Technology is too young a field to be bitterly entrenched, who can really be an expert in a field that is only 5-20 years old?  The main part of the "Unix philosophy" is to iterate quickly, build anew, and hold no cows sacred.  Well, let me tell you-developer toxicity is not a feature, its a bug.  We are what could be considered the Pre-Cambrian era in which more species then we will even know became extinct.  Culture in general is a brand new environment to cultivate, just recently stitched back together from past tatters.  No one has the home field advantage here, we can we win this for ourselves and for the next generation who will be here and blowing our minds before this even publishes.
